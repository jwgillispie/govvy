Provides that a child is a CHINS if, before the child becomes 18 years of age: (1) the child's physical or mental health is seriously endangered due to failure of the child's parent, guardian, or custodian to protect the child from exposure to the use, possession, sale, or manufacture of illegal drugs; and (2) the child needs care, treatment, or rehabilitation that the child is not receiving and that is unlikely to be provided or accepted without the coercive intervention of the court. Removes a rebuttable presumption in current law that a child's physical or mental health is seriously endangered based on evidence of illegal manufacture of a drug or controlled substance occurring at the child's residence and provides that there is a rebuttable presumption that a child is a CHINS if the court finds that the child's parent, guardian, or custodian willfully or knowingly: (1) exposed the child to the illegal manufacture or distribution of a legend drug or controlled substance; or (2) exposed the child to: (A) methamphetamine; (B) fentanyl; or (C) a fentanyl containing substance; for which the parent, guardian, or custodian did not have a valid prescription.

Specifies that the requirement that a court reviewing a dispositional decree must determine whether the department has made reasonable efforts to provide family services does not apply if a finding has been made that reasonable efforts for family preservation or reunification are not required. Provides that in determining the extent to which reasonable efforts to reunify or preserve a family are appropriate, the child's welfare (in addition to the child's health and safety, under current law) is of paramount concern.
