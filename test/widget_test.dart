// This is a basic Flutter widget test.

// To perform an interaction with a widget in your test, use the WidgetTester
// utility in the flutter_test package. For example, you can send tap and scroll
// gestures. You can also use WidgetTester to find child widgets in the widget
// tree, read text, and verify that the values of widget properties are correct.

    // This is a workaround until we properly mock Firebase dependencies
    // The important part is that the main() function exists to satisfy the test runner
